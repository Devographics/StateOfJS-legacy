    Thanks for taking this survey! Together, maybe we'll be able to figure out this CSS thing once and for all!

    Also, we know this survey seems long, but it's mostly the same questions repeated for different frameworks and libraries. Most people only take around *10 minutes* to fill it in.

#  note: rather than test if the value is equal to "undefined" we need to 
#  test if it's empty. Uncomment when we find a way to do that, until then always show
#  the country and city fields.
