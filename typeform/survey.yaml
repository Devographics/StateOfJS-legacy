    Thanks for taking this survey! Together, maybe we'll be able to figure out this JavaScript thing once and for all! (yeah right…)

    Also, I know this survey seems long, but it's mostly the same questions repeated a bunch of times for different frameworks and libraries. Most people only take around *10 minutes* to fill it in.
