Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

And what’s this month’s recommended way of dealing with CSS?</p>\\n<p>Like you, I spent far too many hours reading about all this, and at the end I <em>still</em> wasn’t sure. So I decided to create this survey to see what everybody else thinks:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"take-survey\\\">\\n  <a class=\\\"take-survey-button\\\" href=\\\"https://stateofjs.typeform.com/to/aYkckG\\\">Take the Survey</a>\\n</div>\\n<p>The survey shouldn’t take you more than 10-15 minutes. Good luck!</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./intro.md\n ** module id = 427\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\n\t\"title\": \"Create pages from JSON!\",\n\t\"imagine\": \"What you can do with raw data\",\n\t\"integrationsWithOtherSystems\": {\n\t\t\"possible\": true,\n\t\t\"awesome\": true\n\t}\n};\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./json.json\n ** module id = 428\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","import React from 'react'\nimport './example.less'\nimport DocumentTitle from 'react-document-title'\nimport { config } from 'config'\n\nexport default class Less extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <DocumentTitle title={`${config.siteTitle} | Hi lessy friends`}>\n        <div>\n          <h1\n            className=\"the-less-class\"\n          >\n            Hi lessy friends\n          </h1>\n          <div className=\"less-nav-example\">\n            <h2>Nav example</h2>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <a href=\"#\">Store</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <a href=\"#\">Help</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <a href=\"#\">Logout</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </DocumentTitle>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./less.js\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"I'm a markdown file!\",\"body\":\"<p>Markdown is pretty cool if you ask me.</p>\\n<h2>You can have lists</h2>\\n<h3>Numbered</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>me first!</li>\\n<li>I’m second!</li>\\n<li>third :(</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Unordered</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Cheese</li>\\n<li>is actually</li>\\n<li>really good</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And <strong>lots</strong> of other <em>fun</em> stuff.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Block quotes are\\nwritten like so.</p>\\n<p>They can span multiple paragraphs,\\nif you like.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Enable additional syntax with Markdown-it plugins</h2>\\n<p>You can add additional Markdown-it plugins with\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/blob/master/loaders/markdown-loader/index.js#L22-L32\\\">a custom markdown loader</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Subscript</h3>\\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>0</p>\\n<h3>Footnote</h3>\\n<p>Here is an inline note.<sup class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn1\\\" id=\\\"fnref1\\\">[1]</a></sup></p>\\n<h3>Definition lists</h3>\\n<dl>\\n<dt>Term 1</dt>\\n<dd>\\n<p>Definition 1</p>\\n</dd>\\n<dt>Term 2 with <em>inline markup</em></dt>\\n<dd>\\n<p>Definition 2</p>\\n<pre><code>  { some code, part of Definition 2 }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Third paragraph of definition 2.</p>\\n</dd>\\n</dl>\\n<h3>Abbriviation</h3>\\n<p>The <abbr title=\\\"Hyper Text Markup Language\\\">HTML</abbr> specification\\nis maintained by the <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C</abbr>.</p>\\n<h3>Add a class or other attributes to content.</h3>\\n<p class=\\\"warning\\\">here be dragons</p>\\n<h2>Some code</h2>\\n<p>Javascript</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">$initHighlight</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">block, flags</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">try</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> (block.className.search(<span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\bno\\\\-highlight\\\\b/</span>) != <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">-1</span>)\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> processBlock(block, <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0x0F</span>) + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' class=\\\"\\\"'</span>;\\n  } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">catch</span> (e) {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/* handle exception */</span>\\n  }\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> i = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span> / <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>;
