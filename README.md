# Getting Started

`npm install`

`gatsby develop`

`git checkout results`

# How Gatsby Works

- Any file in the `pages` directory will automatically get its own route (unless its name starts with "_").
- `.csv` and `.json` can be `import`ed and used as JSON directly. `.md` files can be `import`ed and used as React components. 

# Pages

- http://localhost:8000/mobile/
- http://localhost:8000/testing/
