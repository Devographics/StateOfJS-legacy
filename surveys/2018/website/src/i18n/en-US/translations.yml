intros:
    javascript-flavors: >
        As JavaScript matures, developers are starting to look
        beyond its borders and create various languages and dialects that
        compile to JavaScript. 
    front-end-frameworks: >
        The front-end remains the key battleground for JavaScript. But now
        that the dust has cleared, it's starting to look like only two
        combattants are left standing…
    data-layer: >
        The data layer regroups all the technologies used to transmit and manage data. 
        It's a vast category where many approaches compete to make a tricky problem more
        approachable.
    back-end-frameworks: >
        JavaScript on the back-end hasn't seen any major breakthroughs in recent years. 
        But compared to the rest of the ecosystem's frenetic pace,
        many will say that this is a blessing, not a curse. 
    testing: >
        Testing, testing… Is this thing on? Sorry, I Jest, but I would never want to make a Mocha-ry 
        of this section. That would be Jasmine (“just mean”? get it?), and that's bad Karma.
    mobile-and-desktop: >
        “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”
        JavaScript is not limited to the browser anymore, and it's only
        a matter of time until your smart toaster burns your bread because NPM is down. 
    other-tools: >
        Other tools that didn't quite fit in any other category.
    opinions: >
        To find out how developers view the current JavaScript ecosystem, 
        we asked them how much they agreed or disagreed with the following opinions.

        We wanted to learn more about our survey respondents.
