The State of JavaScript survey is a volunteer project, but in order to make the
project sustainable we’re always looking for partners who can help support us,
either financially or by helping us spread the word.

If you think you could help in any way, please don’t hesitate to
<a href="mailto:hello@stateofjs.com">get in touch</a>!
