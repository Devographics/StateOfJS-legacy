This year, we reached 20,268 developers in 153 different countries. While the **U.S.** dominates the survey as expected with 24% of respondents, **Germany** and **Australia** are both well-represented, with over 5% of respondents each. 

Of course, we should mention that although we're doing our best to get as many developers as we can to fill out the survey, our audience is still only a small fraction of the overall JavaScript community, and you should keep this in mind when evaluating the following results.  

Note: one factor that could definitely help us reach broader, more international audiences in the future would be translating the survey and survey results in multiple languages. If you think you can help, please [let us know](https://github.com/StateOfJS/StateOfJS/issues/87)!
