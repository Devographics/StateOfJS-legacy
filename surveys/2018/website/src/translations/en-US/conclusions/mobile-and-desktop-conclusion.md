 This category shows clearly how JavaScript has expanded its "scope" far beyond the limits of the browser.

**React Native** and **Electron** are the two leading solutions to build mobile and desktop apps using web technologies. Coincidentally, they show similar numbers in both satisfaction ratio and number of users.

Electron's versatility (it can work with any UI framework, even if it's often associated with React or Vue.js) may explain why it got the highest satisfaction ratio of the category.

But things are far from settled: Airbnb recently published [a thorough series of article](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) explaining why they decided to drop React Native for their next products in favor of Native Apps.

As an alternative to React Native, developers who want to write cross-platform applications in JavaScript without using React patterns can check out [Weex](https://weex.apache.org/), which lets them use the Vue.js eco-system.

And Google has many interesting entrants in the space as well. There's [Carlo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo), a brand new “Headful Node app framework” released by Google and built on top of [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/puppeteer); as well as [Flutter](https://flutter.io/): instead of building a JavaScript "bridge" as React Native does, it compiles to true native code. But the code is written in Dart, so at the end of the day React Native will be still relevant to most of JavaScript developers already familiar with the React system.
