<span class="first-line"><span class="first-letter">JavaScript</span> is always changing.</span> New libraries, new frameworks, new languages… It's part of the fun, but it can also feel overhwelming sometimes. 

That's where the State of JavaScript survey comes in: this year, we surveyed over 20,000 JavaScript developers to figure out what they're using, what they're happy with, and what they want to learn. And the result is a unique collection of stats and insights that will hopefully help you make your own way through the JavaScript ecosystem. 

### What's New

Just like JavaScript, the survey itself has been changing too. Here's what's new this year.

- You might notice the **new, darker color theme**. Yes, dark themes are trendy (we’ll let it go this time Apple, but please stop copying us) but we’re also hoping it makes the charts more readable. 
- Also, there will be **no CSS section** this year. CSS is such a vast topic it would almost merit a survey of its own, so rather than do things halfway we decided to focus on JavaScript this time. 
- Since we were cutting down on the number of questions, we decided to make each of them more detailed by asking **follow-up questions** to figure out the reasons why people were using (or not using) a given library. You'll find those in the “likes” and “dislikes” charts. 
- And since we now had more data, we decided to give each tool and library their **own individual result page**. 
- We also made **every chart shareable**, so don't hesitate to tweet or share any data that catches your eye. 
- Since we now have 3 years of data, we've incorporated **historical trends over time** in the charts whenever possible. 
- Finally, be sure to check out our new **Awards** section! We had a lot of fun making it, and we hope you like it too.

### Resources

We figure a lot of you are checking out this survey to help you figure out what to learn next. So we've included links to useful JavaScript resources throughout the survey to help point you in the right direction. 

Full disclosure: some of them are paid sponsorships, but no matter what they're all high quality resources from people we know and respect who have decided to support our project.
