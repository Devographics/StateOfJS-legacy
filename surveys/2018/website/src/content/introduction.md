I'm writing these lines somewhere high above Russia. I'm on my way to a JavaScript conference, because as it turns out there's people willing to fly me halfway across the world just so they can hear me talk about the very data presented here. 

If you ask me, that's a pretty good measure of how popular this survey has become, and by extension how fast the JavaScript ecosystem keeps growing.

After all, if JavaScript never changed, there would be no need to do this survey every year. We'd just put up a landing page with a big “see previous year” link and call it a day. 

But JavaScript *is* changing, and so here we are again. Me high above Russia in a cramped airplane seat, you rocking back in your office chair and getting ready to dig through dozens of charts, visualizations, and assorted graphs. 

### What's New

The survey itself has been changing too. You might notice the **new, darker color theme**. Yes, dark themes are trendy (we’ll let it go for this time Apple, but please stop copying us) but we’re also hoping it makes the charts pop more. 

Also, there will be **no CSS section** this year. CSS is such a vast topic it would almost merit a survey of its own, so rather than do things halfway we decided to focus on JavaSript this time. 

Since we were cutting down on the number of questions, we decided to make each of them more detailed by asking **follow-up questions** to figure out the reasons why people were using (or not using) a given library. You'll find those in the “likes” and “dislikes” charts. 

And since we now had more data, we decided to give each tool and library their **own individual result page**. 

We also made **every chart shareable** through a little bit of [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) black magic to generate dedicated meta tags. So if a chart –whether bar or pie– catches your eye, don't be shy; and share that guy!

Finally, since we now have 3 years of data, we tried to incorporate **historical trends over time** in the charts whenever possible. 

### Resources

We figure a lot of you are checking out this survey to help you figure out what to learn next. So we've included links to useful JavaScript resources throughout the survey to help point you in the right direction. 

Full disclosure: some of them are paid sponsorships, but no matter what they're all high quality resources from people we know and respect who have decided to support our project. 

### Team

The State of JavaScript Survey is created and maintained by:

And now, let's see what JavaScript has been up to this year!

P.S. We put a lot of work and care into this year's site, so please don't go clicking around breaking things!
