[Meteor](http://meteor.com/) is the pioneer of full-stack frameworks, with an active community and a strong ecosystem, so it's no surprise that it's known by 90% of respondents.

Meteor may be the most popular solution in terms of GitHub stars (more than 35,000), but the [MEAN](http://mean.io/) (Mongo + Express + AngularJS + Node.js) stack was used by almost twice as many users in our survey (3000 vs 1700). Moreover, satisfaction levels are better for Mean (66%) than for Meteor (59%).

Take MEAN, replace AngularJS by React-Redux and you get the [MERN](http://mern.io/) stack, the new fancy kid in town. It seems that many developers went from Angular to React and they seem to be very satisfied (an impressive 86%), even though the total number of users is low compared to Meteor and MEAN (around 450).

[FeathersJS](http://feathersjs.com/) and [DoneJS](https://donejs.com/) have very little traction. In fact DoneJS has not been updated for 6 months on Github.

That being said, FeathersJS seems to be more appropriate as an API layer, its service-oriented architecture and its real-time capabilities providing a nice way to build decoupled applications. From a personnal point of view, I like this micro-services-oriented approach over the monolithic approach favored by true full-stack frameworks like Meteor.
