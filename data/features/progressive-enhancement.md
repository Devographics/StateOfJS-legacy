With all this talk of fancy JavaScript features, it's easy to forget that not everybody benefits from them. 

And no need to travel to faraway lands here: just whip out your brand new, state-of-the-art phone and many sites and apps become unusable due to bloat, incompatibilities, and crappy mobile connectins. 

This is why **progressive enhancement** is still important: it's about making sure your app can be used in as many situations as possible, without sacrificing what made it worth using in the first place.
