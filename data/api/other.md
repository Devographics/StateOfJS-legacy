**JSON API** was frequently mentioned, but it's a little different from the rest (no pun intended) in that it's a [specification](http://jsonapi.org/) and not a library. 

**Meteor** was another popular choice, and the fact that it enjoys such popularity as a self-hosted back-end explains why the Meteor team recently decided to refocus their effort on the API layer with Apollo, the afore-mentioned GraphQL solution. 

The rest of the ecosystem is very fragmented, and the reponses also show how large the “API layer” umbrella really is, with answers ranging from full-on server-side frameworks like **Rails**, to back-end-only libraries like **Deployd**.
